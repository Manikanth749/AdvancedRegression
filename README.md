# Housing Project Advanced Regression
> In a regularization-based polynomial regression project, the focus is on determining significant variables that predict house prices using techniques like Lasso or Ridge. Evaluation metrics such as MSE and R-squared assess how well the selected variables describe house prices, ensuring the model's predictive accuracy.
